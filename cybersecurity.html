<p id="head">"One single vulnerability is all an attacker needs"</p>

<p class='firstpara'>"Cyber Security is the body of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, theft, damage, modification or unauthorized access.
<br>
<br>
We can divide cybersecurity into two parts one is cyber, and the other is security. Cyber refers to the technology that includes systems, networks, programs, and data. And security is concerned with the protection of systems, networks, applications, and information. In some cases, it is also called electronic information security or information technology security.</p>


<h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2>
<p>Today we live in a digital era where all aspects of our lives depend on the network, computer and other electronic devices, and software applications. All critical infrastructure such as the banking system, healthcare, financial institutions, governments, and manufacturing industries use devices connected to the Internet as a core part of their operations. Some of their information, such as intellectual property, financial data, and personal data, can be sensitive for unauthorized access or exposure that could have negative consequences.Cyber-attack is now an international concern that hacks the system, and other security attacks could endanger the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to have an excellent cybersecurity strategy to protect sensitive information from high-profile security breaches. </p>


<h2>Cyber Security Goals</h2>
<p>Cyber Security's main objective is to ensure data protection. The security community provides a triangle of three related principles to protect the data from cyber-attacks. This principle is called the CIA triad.</p>

</div>
<p>CIA model is actually a security model that helps people to think about various parts of IT security. It has the following three parts:-</p>

<div class="sark">
<details>
<summary> <h3>Confidentiality:</h3></summary>
Confidentiality is equivalent to privacy that avoids unauthorized access of information.Data encryption is an excellent example of ensuring confidentiality.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Integrity:</h3></summary>
This principle ensures that the data is authentic, accurate, and safeguarded from unauthorized modification by threat actors or accidental user modification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Availability:</h3></summary>
This principle makes the information to be available and useful for its authorized people always. It ensures that these accesses are not hindered by system malfunction or cyber-attacks.

<h2>Types of Cyber Security</h2>
<p>We can categorise CyberSecurity in the following major sub-domains:-</p>

<h3>Network Security:</h3><p> It involves implementing the hardware and software to secure a computer network from unauthorized access, intruders, attacks, disruption, and misuse. This security helps an organization to protect its assets against external and internal threats.</p>

<h3>Application Security: </h3><p>It involves protecting the software and devices from unwanted threats. This protection can be done by constantly updating the apps to ensure they are secure from attacks. Successful security begins in the design stage, writing source code, validation, threat modeling, etc., before a program or device is deployed.</p>

<h3>Information or Data Security:</h3><p> It involves implementing a strong data storage mechanism to maintain the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</p>

<h3>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning:</h3><p> It deals with the processes, monitoring, alerts, and plans to how an organization responds when any malicious activity is causing the loss of operations or data. Its policies dictate resuming the lost operations after any disaster happens to the same operating capacity as before the event.</p>

<h3>Operational security:</h3><p> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</p>

<h2>Cyber Safety Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update your software and operating system regularly.</li>
<li>Use strong passwords.</li>
<li>Do not open email attachments from unknown senders:These <li>could be infected with malware.</li>
<li>Do not click on links in emails from unknown senders or <li>unfamiliar websites.</li>
<li>Avoid using unsecure WiFi networks in public places.</li>
<li>Use anti-virus software.</li>
<li>Backup data regularly.</li>
<li>Perform periodic security reviews.</li>
</ul>
